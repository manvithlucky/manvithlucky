- 👀 I’m interested in ...Ethical Hacking

# Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of my cybersecurity projects, labs, and learning resources. I am a student passionate about ethical hacking, network security, penetration testing, and everything in between. This repository showcases my journey in cybersecurity and serves as a place for experimentation, learning, and collaboration.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔐 Penetration Testing Tools
A set of tools and scripts I've created or used in various penetration testing exercises.

- **Wireshark** - A network protocol analyzer that helps capture and analyze network packets. This tool is useful for identifying vulnerabilities in network traffic and understanding communication protocols. It’s widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and security auditing.
  - **Example Use**: Capturing unencrypted passwords in HTTP traffic, detecting suspicious network activity, analyzing packet flows for vulnerabilities.

### 🌐 Web Application Security
Exploring common vulnerabilities and testing web application security.

- **OWASP Top 10 Projects** - Exercises based on the OWASP Top 10 security vulnerabilities.
- **XSS Testing** - Examples of Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities and how to exploit and mitigate them.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash, C, JavaScript
- **Tools**: Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, Docker
- **Frameworks**: OWASP, Security+ Best Practices, CEH Techniques

## 🌱 Learning & Collaboration

I’m continuously learning and experimenting with the latest cybersecurity tools, techniques, and methodologies. Feel free to browse through the projects and contribute if you find something interesting.

If you're a fellow cybersecurity enthusiast or professional, I’m open to collaborating, sharing knowledge, or discussing new trends in the field. Let’s learn and grow together!
